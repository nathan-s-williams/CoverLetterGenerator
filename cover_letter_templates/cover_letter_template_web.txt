Dear Hiring Manager,

Furthermore, I have practical experience in creating full stack applications using the Jakarta EE framework, implementing the 3-tier model in my Advanced Java class. Finally, my work experience taught me the importance of writing clean and efficient code in order to optimize performance and enhance maintainability. I am eager to use these skills to drive successful projects at your company.

Aside from my technical background, I have a wealth of soft skills that will be helpful to your company. I am a team player and I do not shy away from working with others to accomplish the task at hand.
